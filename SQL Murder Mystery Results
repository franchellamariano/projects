# SQL Murder Mystery Results

My SQL queries and results from the game [SQL Murder Mystery](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries)


## Prompt
-- A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a ​murder​ that occurred sometime on ​Jan.15, 2018​ and that it took place in ​SQL City​. Start by retrieving the corresponding crime scene report from the police department’s database.


## Exploring the Database Structure

SELECT name 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE type = 'table'

SELECT sql 
FROM sqlite_master
WHERE name = 'crime_scene_report'

## Reading the Report

SELECT description
FROM 'crime_scene_report'
WHERE date = '20180115' and city = 'SQL City' and type = 'murder' 
-- Security footage shows that there were 2 witnesses. The first witness lives at the last house on "Northwestern Dr". The second witness, named Annabel, lives somewhere on "Franklin Ave".          

## Gathering Witness Information

SELECT address_number
FROM 'person'
WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr'
ORDER BY address_number DESC
LIMIT 1 
-- address number: 4919

WITH WitnessMorty AS (
    SELECT id 
  	FROM person
    WHERE address_street_name = 'Northwestern Dr' AND address_number = '4919'
), WitnessAnnabel AS (
    SELECT id FROM person
    WHERE INSTR(name, 'Annabel') AND address_street_name = 'Franklin Ave'
), Witnesses AS (
    SELECT *, 1 AS witness FROM WitnessMorty
    UNION
    SELECT *, 2 AS witness FROM WitnessAnnabel
)
SELECT witness, transcript FROM Witnesses
LEFT JOIN interview ON Witnesses.id = interview.person_id
-- witness	transcript
    1	I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z". Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
    2	I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.


## Gathering Information

SELECT plate_number
FROM 'drivers_license'
WHERE plate_number LIKE "%H42W%" AND gender = "male" 
-- possible plate numbers: 0H42W2, 4H42WR

SELECT name
FROM 'get_fit_now_member'
LEFT JOIN get_fit_now_check_in 
ON get_fit_now_member.id = get_fit_now_check_in.membership_id
WHERE membership_status = 'gold' AND check_in_date = '20180109' AND id LIKE '48Z%' 
-- possible names: eremy Bowers, Joe Germuska

SELECT license_id
FROM 'person'
WHERE name = 'Joe Germuska'
-- Joe's License ID: 173289

SELECT license_id
FROM 'person'
WHERE name = 'Jeremy Bowers'
-- Jeremy's License ID: 423327

SELECT plate_number
FROM drivers_license
WHERE id = '173289'
-- no data found

SELECT plate_number
FROM drivers_license
WHERE id = '423327'
-- Plate #: 0H42W2

## RESULTS

INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Jeremy Bowers');
        
        SELECT value FROM solution; 
-- RESULTS: Congrats, you found the murderer! But wait, there's more... If you think you're up for a challenge, try querying the interview transcript of the murderer to find the real villain behind this crime. If you feel especially confident in your SQL skills, try to complete this final step with no more than 2 queries. Use this same INSERT statement with your new suspect to check your answer.


## Finding the Brains Behind the Operation

SELECT id
FROM person
WHERE name = 'Jeremy Bowers'
-- ID: 67318

SELECT transcript
FROM 'interview'
WHERE person_id = '67318'
-- Transcript: I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.
